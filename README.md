# Location spoofing

## Geo Location
Geolocation refers to the use of location technologies such as GPS or IP addresses to identify and track the whereabouts of connected electronic devices.Geolocation is frequently used to track people's movements and locations as well as for surveillance purposes because people frequently carry these devices.

## Geolocation Testing
Geolocation testing checks your application in different geographic locations to ensure that it meets all  legal requirements related to those locations and  works as expected regardless of location. This includes checking the validity of the application in each geographic location where it may be used. Check the application  efficiency and performance of IP in various locations.

## Location Spoofing

## Need for location spoofing
The main purpose of location spoofing in testing is to create several situations and places in order to assess how a service or application performs under various circumstances.
