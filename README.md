## Geolocation Testing
Geolocation testing checks your application in different geographic locations to ensure that it meets all  legal requirements related to those locations and  works as expected regardless of location. This includes checking the validity of the application in each geographic location where it may be used. Check the application  efficiency and performance of IP in various locations.
